This is the React Native version of DateSpot. A previous attempt of creating DateSpot with React Native was done with the Expo build tools.

I decided to start this project again but with vanilla React Native as there were a few issues with Expo that felt really off to me. I have detailed those issues in the readme of that repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/Nimzyow/datespot-reactnative-expo)

The initial commit for this repo kicks off from the end of the Expo version and I will continue working with vanilla React Native from here on out.
